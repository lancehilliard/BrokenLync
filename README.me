Lync 2010's keyboard shortcuts can be problematic in some situations[1]. This AHK script intercepts those keyboard shortcuts and changes their behavior.

[1] Included scripts:

**AllowSaveAllInVisualStudioWhenLyncScreenSharingIsBeingUsed.ahk**  
When screen sharing w/ Lync, Ctrl-Shift-S stops the screen sharing. That's problematic when you're screen sharing with another developer and want to use that keyboard shortcut to "Save All" in Visual Studio. This script allows you to "Save All" in Visual Studio without stopping screen sharing in Lync.

**SaveOnImWindowClose.ahk**  
This script manually issues Ctrl-S (Save IM in Outlook) whenever you close an IM window with Escape, Alt-F4, or Ctrl-F4. It then closes the IM window.
